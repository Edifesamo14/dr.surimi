This course focuses on the fundamental principles of structural dynamics and their applications. We depart from the single-degree-of-freedom system and its generalization, considering free and forced vibration, undamped and damped systems, and the response of dynamic loads by modal superposition in the time and frequency domains. Finally, we will determine a structureâ€™s responses to relevant load cases (e.g., earthquake and wind).
