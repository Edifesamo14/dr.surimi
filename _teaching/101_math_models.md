This course is a formal introduction to the basis of mathematical modeling, with an emphasis on its Python implementation in applied science and industry problems. We will cover problems related to a variety of disciplines, such as biology, earth sciences, and physics. In the above, calculation and optimization strategies related to computer science and mathematics will be applied to the basic mathematical models studied (i.e., dynamic programming, linear programming, continuous and discrete dynamical systems, and linear transformation applications), with take-home work and labs. The students will have to present the results of a research project related to an interesting research topic.Â
