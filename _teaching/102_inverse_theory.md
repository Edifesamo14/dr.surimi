> The goal of the course is to introduce the basic concepts of inverse theory and its application to earth science problems. The course is mostly lecture-based but has three exams with computing exercises. A variety of topics are covered, such as ill-posed, linear, non-linear, and joint inversion problems, by applying optimization techniques and machine learning algorithms.Â
