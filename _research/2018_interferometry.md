Seismological observations allow us to analyze the internal crust structure at different depth scales through wave-field dispersion and properties. We employ dense seismic databases deployed in Guerrero state that contain active and passive sources. We carried out a massive Greens Function correlation (C3 method) due to the ray density. Obtaining shear and group velocity tomograms and relative changes in seismic velocity close to critical zones of slow slip phenomena.Â
