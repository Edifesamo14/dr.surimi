> Seismological observations allow us to see the internal crust structure at different scales and analyze it, through wave-field properties, such as dispersion. 
However, in view of constructing tomographic images with the highest resolution that algorithms and data allow, 
in order to solve the inverse problems in 
by correlating seismic noise and is also possible to increase density and 
Shear wave, group, and phase velocity tomograms are particularly suitable for such studies, and
