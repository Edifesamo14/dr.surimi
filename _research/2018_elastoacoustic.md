Seismic wave propagation in coupled media is a challenging problem, commonly addressed by solving partial differential equations through numerical methods. We proposed a method for simulating wave propagation in elasto-acoustic medium using the finite element and finite differences methods and a strong coupling strategy, allowing a joint simulation of seismic sources and tsunami generation. This strategy seems to be promising in elastodynamic problems and far-field tsunami simulations due to the fastest calculations of physical features (i.e., displacement and time arrivals).
