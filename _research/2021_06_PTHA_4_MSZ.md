Subduction zones are prone to large earthquakes that impact populated coastal and inland cities due to strong shaking and can generate potentially disastrous tsunamis. Even though the population and infrastructure in these zones may experience tsunamis, only sparse instrumentation and scarce tsunami observations exist for both historical and instrumental records, especially above Mw8.0 magnitudes. Using ensembles of numerical tsunami simulations, it is possible to estimate the probability of exceedance of tsunami intensity metrics, considering the contribution of critical parameters. The figure shown below presents the results of a probabilistic tsunami hazard analysis, carried out with 7,946 scenarios. The amplitudes can reach up to 9.5 m along the shoreline, revealing critical hazard points along the coasts of the states of Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca.
